# File_Organizer
**Organize Files the Stress-Free Way**

File_Organizer works like a digital assistant for your files. It can combine automatic organization with human-friendly controls. It also can track every action, letting you experiment freely knowing you can always rewind mistakes. Regular updates keep the tool focus on real-world needs rather than unnecessary complexity.
### üìÇ Smart Auto-Sorting and tools

- Automatically moves files to folders by type (documents, images, etc.).
- Finds duplicate files by content (not just names).
- Shows file previews for quick checking (text/images).
- Tracks every change in an activity log.

### ‚èÆÔ∏è Safety First

- Undo accidental file moves.
- All operations can be reversed.
- Never lose files by mistake.
